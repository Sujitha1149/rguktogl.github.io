            <p>Women Empowerment and Gender Equality are the most important requirements for the upliftment and progress
                of
                our nation. In the effort to make Ramanujan College a strong kernel of gender sensitization,
                the Women Development Cell (WDC) was constituted in November 2016 under the able convenor-ship of Dr.
                Madhu
                Batta. The Cell has both the faculty and students of the College as its members and works with an aim to
                create a gender sensitized community within campus as well as in the society. It has been organising
                varied
                academic, technical, medical, cultural and social events for the upliftment of women and spread the real
                importance of gender equality in the society through College students.</p>
